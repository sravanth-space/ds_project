 Yes â€” **a higher Q means a stronger and cleaner QPO.**

Letâ€™s break that down clearly, so you can **explain and defend it** in your project or report.

## What Is Q (Quality Factor) in QPOs?

In the context of **quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs)** in astrophysical light curves, the **Q factor** is defined as:

\[
Q = \frac{f_0}{\Delta f}
\]

Where:
- \( f_0 \) is the **central frequency** of the QPO peak
- \( \Delta f \) is the **width** (typically full-width at half-maximum or HWHM)

##  What Does Q Tell Us?

| Q Value | Interpretation                     | Meaning                                     |
|---------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ~0â€“2    | Broad bump, likely noise            | Noisy, non-periodic                         |
| ~3â€“5    | Weak, smeared QPO                  | Low coherence, possibly transient QPO       |
| >5      | Strong, narrow QPO                  | Highly coherent QPO (astrophysically real)  |
| >10     | Exceptional QPO                     | Very strong candidate for resonance-based QPO |

###  So yes: **Higher Q = cleaner, more coherent oscillation.**

##  Real Example: REJ1034+396

From Middleton et al. (2011, 2020):

- Detected QPO at \( f_0 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-4} \) Hz
- Width \( \Delta f \approx 0.3 \times 10^{-4} \) Hz
- So:
\[
Q \approx \frac{2.6 \times 10^{-4}}{0.3 \times 10^{-4}} = \textbf{~8.7}
\]

â†’ This is a **strong QPO**.

## ðŸŽ“ Why Astronomers Use Q

Q is used to:
- Classify signal coherence
- Differentiate real QPOs from red noise
- Compare across different systems (black holes, neutron stars)

---

##  Your Usage (SBI + Lorentzian + GAN)

In your project:
- You compute Q via Lorentzian fit
- You combine Q with SBI-inferred `fc_std` and `amp_mean`
- You use Q as:
  -  A feature in your classifier
  - ðŸ”’ A scientific constraint for detection

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bottom Line:

> **The higher the Q, the more confident you can be that a true QPO exists.**  
> Use it alongside amplitude and SBI variance for best detection performance.
