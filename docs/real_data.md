###  Light Curve Structure:
- **“ltcrv4bands_rej_dt100.dat”** contains:
  - **4 light curves** = 4 columns → 4 energy bands
  - **~900 time bins** → 880 bins to be exact
  - **dt = 100 seconds** per time bin
  - ➕ That gives **~88,000 seconds** of observation (~24.4 hours)

> This directly matches what you loaded earlier: a matrix of shape `(880, 4)`

###  Target Source: RE J1034+396 (NLS1 galaxy)

- This is a well-known source with one of the few **confirmed QPOs in an AGN**
- As cited:  
  *Gierliński et al. (2008)*, *Vaughan 2010*, *Alston et al. 2014*

###  Known QPO:
- QPO frequency: **2.6 × 10⁻⁴ Hz** = **~1 hour period**
- This is very low frequency, but still shows up in the PSD as a **bump or peak** near `0.00025–0.0003 Hz`

---

## Why Your Supervisor’s Data Is Special

- You are working with **a rare real example of a QPO** in a supermassive black hole!
- That's why your GAN + SBI analysis is so important:
  - Can your generator learn to recreate these signals?
  - Can SBI **recover fc and amp** that match theory?

###  QPO Detection: What It Says

The QPO frequency appears **consistently** across epochs:

> > “The dominant QPO detected is at a frequency of **~2.6 × 10⁻⁴ Hz**, or a period of ~1 hour”

 This **directly matches** what I told you earlier.

---

### 🔬 Context Across Papers

| Paper | QPO Frequency | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| **Gierliński et al. (2008)** | ~2.7e⁻⁴ Hz | First detection of QPO |
| **Alston et al. (2014)** | Confirmed in Rev 1741 | New analysis using XMM |
| **Alston et al. (2020)** | **2.6e⁻⁴ Hz** confirmed again | Includes Rev 3837 – your data! |

 Your `.dat` file comes from **Rev 3837**, and this paper confirms **a QPO is seen again at the same frequency** in that observation.

---

###  What You Can Do with This

- **Use this ground truth (`fc ≈ 2.6e⁻⁴ Hz`)** to benchmark your SBI.
- You could **rescale your inferred `fc`** from SBI to match this true frequency.
- Also validate if your GAN can generate a QPO with similar periodic structure.

---

---

##  Goal: Map real-world QPO `fc = 2.6 × 10⁻⁴ Hz` into your **GAN/SBI-trained frequency scale**

---

###  Your SBI + GAN were trained with:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sampling Rate (`fs`) | `1 Hz` = 1 sample per second |
| Time Series Length | `512 samples` = 512 seconds |
| Trained Frequency Range | `fc ∈ [0.01, 1.0] Hz` (GAN QPO injection range)

---

### 🔭 Your Supervisor's Data:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `fc_real` | `2.6 × 10⁻⁴ Hz` = period ~3846 sec |
| Original `dt` | 100 sec (resampled to 1s for compatibility)

---

## Step-by-Step Mapping

1. **We assume GAN + SBI model everything in fs = 1 Hz units**
2. You resampled the real light curve → now `dt = 1s` = `fs = 1 Hz`
3. So we can **compare directly**

---

### 🔢 Calculate Normalized `fc_model`

You observed:

\[
f_\text{real} = 2.6 \times 10^{-4}\ \text{Hz}
\]

This is **still in the same scale** as GAN/SBI — but it lies **way below your trained range** (`0.01–1.0 Hz`)

>  This means the **real QPO frequency is out-of-domain for your trained models**

---

### 📉 Implication

| Trained `fc` range | Real `fc` | Overlap |
|--------------------|-----------|---------|
| 0.01 to 1.0 Hz     | 0.00026 Hz | Not covered |

Even though your time series are in seconds, the QPO appears at **~3846s period**, and your light curves are only **512s long** — **far too short to capture even one cycle of the real QPO**.

---

## 🔁 Solutions

| Strategy | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Re-train GAN with longer light curves (e.g. 4096 samples) | To cover QPO periods of 1 hour |
| 🔁 Use model units and just scale predictions | e.g., if SBI gives `fc_model = 0.61`, map it as `0.61 / 512 Hz = ~0.0012 Hz` |
| ⚠️ Treat current SBI estimates as **relative proxies** | They detect QPO *structure*, but not physical scale

---

##  Final Note

>  current GAN/SBI framework cannot resolve the real `fc = 0.00026 Hz` **directly**. But it can detect **shape** or **QPO-like structure** that *corresponds* to a low-frequency signal.
