## üîÅ What is ACF?

The **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)** tells you **how similar a signal is to a delayed (lagged) version of itself**. It's a measure of periodicity, repeating patterns, or self-similarity over time.

---

## üß≠ What Are "Lags"?

- A **lag** is simply a time shift applied to the signal.
- At **lag = 0**, you compare the signal with itself ‚Üí correlation = 1.
- At **lag = 1**, you're comparing the signal with a version of itself shifted by 1 time step.
- At **lag = k**, you're looking at how well the signal correlates with itself **k steps ago**.

### üß† Interpretation of Lags in ACF:

| Lag | What It Means                              | ACF Value |
|-----|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 0   | Perfect match with itself                  | 1.0 (always) |
| 1   | How similar the current value is to the previous one | depends on structure |
| k   | How much the signal "repeats" after k steps | High values at k ‚Üí periodicity |

### üåÄ In QPOs:

Quasi-periodic signals are **almost periodic**. So in ACF, you‚Äôll see:

- A **strong central peak** at lag = 0 (always).
- A sequence of **regularly spaced side-peaks** at lags equal to the QPO period and its multiples.

For example, if your QPO has frequency `f = 0.2 Hz`:

- Period \( T = 1/f = 5 \) seconds
- At **lag = 5, 10, 15, 20, ...**, you should see **peaks** in ACF

This means the signal **repeats** roughly every 5 time steps (at fs = 1 Hz), revealing the hidden QPO structure.

### üîç Visual Insight from Your Plot:

In your earlier ACF plots:
- **QPO samples** showed **clean, repeating oscillations** in ACF
- **No-QPO samples** had mostly random fluctuations around zero (no repeating structure)

---

## ‚úÖ Summary:

- **Lag** = how far back you shift the time series.
- **ACF(lag)** = correlation between `x[t]` and `x[t - lag]`
- Repeating peaks in ACF ‚áí signal has **periodic or quasi-periodic structure** (like a QPO!)
