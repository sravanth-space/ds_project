Detection of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in Neutron Star Light Curves Using Neural Networks


# Project overview.

- Detecting periodic signals in stochastic random walk data from black holes
- Build a GAN to simulate time series like those seen from accreting black holes
- Will be based on and architecture of e.g. RNN vs LSTM, or LSTM vs GRU
- Trained on properties of real data (power spectrum / ACF)
- Data from X-ray telescope called XMM-Newton will be supplied from supervisor
- Once GAN is trained we will test output to see if it has properties of real data â€“ power spectrum, log-normal distribution
- If GAN is producing realistic data we can then test this on real data
- Simulation based inference on known periodic detection on power spectrum supplied by supervisor
