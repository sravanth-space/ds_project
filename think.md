Can you rethink our stragery here like finding which chuck is QPO might not work I guess as the real QPO is happeny around 0.00026hz right does our
 chuck is is just 512 does it works?

 🔥 Excellent question — and you're *exactly right* to stop and rethink this.

Your concern is **scientifically valid**:

> If the real QPO is at **~0.00026 Hz**, can a short 512-second light curve chunk *really* detect it?

Let’s break this down carefully — and I’ll help you decide what to do next.

## 🎯 Step 1: Understand the QPO Frequency vs. Chunk Duration

### Real QPO:  
- `fc_real ≈ 0.00026 Hz`  
- This means:
\[
\text{QPO period} = \frac{1}{fc} ≈ 3846 \ \text{seconds}
\]

### Your Chunk:
- 512 seconds long  
- You only see ~**13% of one QPO cycle** in each chunk 😬

---

## 🤯 Insight:
> A QPO is like a "quasi-periodic" oscillation. If you're only looking at **a tiny fraction** of a full oscillation, it's **nearly impossible** to detect reliably in that chunk.

Just like trying to guess if a sine wave exists by looking at a flat line — it's not enough.

## 🔬 So… Can SBI detect such a slow QPO from 512s?

**Not reliably.** Here's why:
- Your GAN was trained on `fc_model ∈ [0.01, 1.0]`, so the **lowest detectable fc** is:
\[
fc_\text{real,min} = \frac{0.01}{512} ≈ 2 \times 10^{-5} \text{Hz}
\]
But in practice, it only starts to work well above:
\[
fc_\text{real} ≈ \frac{0.2}{512} ≈ 3.9 \times 10^{-4} \text{Hz}
\]

So your SBI is most sensitive to:
- QPOs in **~400s–1000s** periods  
- Not the **3846s** period of REJ1034+396

## ✅ What Can You Do?

### Option A – 📏 Use **Larger Chunks** (Recommended)
- Use **8192-second chunks** (≈ 2 full QPO cycles at 0.00026 Hz)
- You'll need to:
  - Retrain GAN/SBI with longer sequence length
  - E.g., sequence length = 8192 (fs = 1Hz)

This allows the network to **see enough structure** to learn.

---

### Option B – 🔍 Global Inference on Full PSD
Instead of chunking:
- Compute **PSD of entire 90000s light curve**
- Feed this full PSD into SBI
- Let it give you the `fc_model`

→ Then scale: `fc_real = fc_model / 90000`

**No need to chunk!**

## 🧠 Suggested Updated Strategy:

| Task                         | Recommendation                       |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| QPO present? (binary)       | ✅ Use full PSD for band             |
| QPO frequency inference     | ✅ Run SBI on full 90000s PSD        |
| Short chunk detection       | ❌ Not reliable for very slow QPOs   |
| Next-gen SBI                | ✅ Retrain with 4096s or 8192s if needed |
